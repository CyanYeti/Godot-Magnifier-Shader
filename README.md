# Godot Magnifier Shader
A Godot shader that magnifies what's behind it. Written in Godot Engine v3.4.4.


###  About
This shader reads from screen texture. So if the image you want to zoom in isn't rendered properly, you may end up with an unwanted result.  

In order to get this shader working in Godot, you must attach this to a node with a texture. It might work with nodes without textures too, but it's not tested yet.
